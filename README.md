# Airflow-Mini-Project


In this project, you’ll use Apache Airflow to create a data pipeline to extract online stock market data and deliver analytical results. You’ll use Yahoo Finance as the data source. Yahoo Finance provides intra-day market price details down a one-minute interval.

The learning objects of this mini project are:
- Use text processing techniques in Python to make sense of logs
- Learn where logs are located in Airflow
- Learn how to monitor automated Airflow DAGs to ensure they are working properly
